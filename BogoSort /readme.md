# Bogo Sort

**Bogo Sort** is a sorting algorithm that operates by randomly shuffling the elements of an array until they are in sorted order. It is notorious for its inefficiency, with an average-case time complexity of O((n+1)!), making it impractical for any real-world sorting tasks. Bogo Sort is not a suitable choice for sorting data due to its random nature and unpredictable performance.

## Implementation

To use Bogo Sort, you need two functions: one that checks if an array is sorted and another that performs the sorting. The `is_sorted` function examines the array and returns `True` if it is sorted in non-decreasing order. The `bogo_sort` function repeatedly shuffles the elements of the array until it is sorted, keeping track of the number of attempts. It's important to note that Bogo Sort is a purely educational algorithm and should not be used in any serious applications.

## Conclusion

In summary, Bogo Sort is an impractical sorting algorithm that serves more as a cautionary example of how not to sort data efficiently. When sorting data in real-world scenarios, it's advisable to use more efficient algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or even Python's built-in `sorted` function.
