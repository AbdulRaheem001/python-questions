Pancake Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly flipping the largest unsorted elements to their correct positions. The algorithm begins by identifying the index of the maximum element in the current unsorted portion of the array. If the maximum element is not already at the end of the array, it performs two flips: first, it moves the maximum element to the beginning of the array, and then it flips the entire array to position the maximum element in its correct sorted place. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

To implement Pancake Sort in Python, we define two helper functions: `flip(arr, k)` and `find_max_index(arr, n)`. The `flip` function reverses the first `k` elements of the array, and `find_max_index` finds the index of the maximum element in the given portion of the array. The main `pancake_sort` function utilizes these helpers to sort the input array. The algorithm iteratively reduces the unsorted portion of the array, finding the maximum element and positioning it correctly, until the array is completely sorted. This elegant approach makes Pancake Sort an interesting algorithm to study and implement.
